# automatedTestSelector

I am currently working on a Jenkins plugin to study the effectiveness of regression test selection (RTS)
and test case prioritization (TCP) techniques in continuous integration (CI) environments.

This repository contains all of the source code for my work, and also contains all of the files generated
by this plugin when running it in debug mode. The files generated by the plugin being run in debug mode can
be ignored; the relevant files are:
  - pom.xml
  + src/main/
    + java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/automatedTestSelector/
      - RegressionTestSelector.java
      - TestList.java // <-- this file currently not being used; may be deleted
      - TestCasePrioritizer.java
      - TestPriority.java
    + resources/
      - index.jelly
